					<p>Data governance is a collection of best practices and policies to help identify, secure, and protect the data assets of a business. It is an important part of any organization&rsquo;s information security program.</p>
					<p>Data governance includes establishing policies and procedures that help you monitor your company&rsquo;s data integrity and privacy, investigate data breaches, detect unauthorized access to sensitive information, and respond to incidents as they occur. Therefore, data governance can be applied in any business to help ensure the integrity of information and its protection from unauthorized access and use.</p>
					<p>In this article we will discuss some of the best <a href="https://www.cegeka.com/nl-nl/oplossingen/data-solutions/data-governance">data governance</a> strategies that work for your business:</p>
					<h3><strong>1. Identify Needs and Scope of Data</strong></h3>
					<p>The first step in data governance is to know what your data needs are. This can be as simple as knowing how many employees you have, or what type of software you run.</p>
					<p>Once you have defined the scope of your data, it&rsquo;s important to decide how that data should be stored and accessed.</p>
					<h3><strong>2. Identify Critical Data Assets</strong></h3>
					<p>The next step in building a strong data governance program is identifying all of your critical data assets. This includes everything from financial records to customer information to source code and other critical assets that would be compromised if not properly protected. Identifying these assets helps you determine what steps need to be taken immediately upon discovering a breach or attack on their systems.</p>
					<h3><strong>3. Create Data Governance Plan</strong></h3>
					<p>A data governance plan is a document that outlines how an organization will manage its data over time, from collection through deletion (or destruction) of records. This type of plan should include: 1) a list of all internal systems that contain personal information; 2) detailed descriptions of each system; 3) clear instructions on how individuals can access their own personal information, and 4) clear instructions about how employees can request access to the business data.</p>
					<h3><strong>4. Create Data Governance Board</strong></h3>
					<p>A data governance board is a group of people who are responsible for ensuring that the right policies, procedures, and standards are in place to ensure that your organization has a strong understanding of its data management practices. These individuals should be able to answer questions such as: "What are the risks associated with this data?" "How do we know if we're complying with all these regulations?" and "What's our plan moving forward?" A good data governance board will also be able to address whether or not there is a need for additional resources within a department or departmental level (e.g., IT or legal).</p>
					<h3><strong>5. Create Policies &amp; Procedures</strong></h3>
					<p>Policies are important because they set forth what actions should be taken when certain situations arise within your organization (such as an unauthorized user accessing a system). These policies should clearly define who has access to what information at what time and how changes can be made without going through a formal approval process.</p>
					<p>Thus, <a href="https://www.cegeka.com/nl-nl/oplossingen/data-solutions/data-governance">data governance</a> is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's an approach that allows organizations to prioritize their needs and make informed decisions about how to protect their most valuable assets &mdash; their data. It is more than just a set-up process anymore; it's an ongoing program that helps businesses keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and business practices.</p>
